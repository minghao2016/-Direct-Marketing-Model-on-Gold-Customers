# -Direct-Marketing-Model-on-Gold-Customers

The business goal is to analyze the influence of managers' decisions with the design of analysis on customer's behavior via direct marketing. 
The statistical data mining procedures are employed in their ability to meet the challenge of mining large amounts of profit-driven data. 
Improve direct marketing responses rate defined by 'gold' customers by modeling on the marketing target (valuable customers) and key drivers

-- We have 6 tables:
  - Target,
  - Customer,
  - Service,
  - Coupon,
  - Spend,
  - Demo_real,

  Because of the size of this tables (Demo_real around 630MB) Unfortunately, I could not attach here even the Sampled table.

there are diffrent stages in this project:

-- Sampling based on the random sample rate
  
-- Explore table
  
-- Data Cleaning:
  - Modify the Date tables,
  - Modify the Missing dada
    
-- Sampling target dataset:
  - Sampling other tables based on the sampled Target IDs, and demo_real based on the mutual Postcodes with customer table
 
-- Data Engineering
  
-- Merging tables
  
-- Extract the valuable features
  
-- Modeling
  
-- Results:
  - Decile charts,
  - Key driver deciles,
  - Importance level of key drivers (STD stimation),
  - KS and ROC chart
